            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Born in St. Louis, I've lived in several states across the United States, including Missouri, Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Iowa. While my first attempt at college didn't go as planned, life had a pleasant surprise in store for me as I met an incredible woman who would later become my wife. Throughout my journey, I've explored many fields and taken on various jobs, each with its own level of success. However, it was during my time as a dental technician that I truly excelled, although I eventually found myself yearning for something more stimulating. A couple years before the pandemic hit, I decided to step away from my career to try something new, running my own business for a period. Yet, the craving for knowledge persisted, leading me to make the life-changing decision to return to school, eager to explore new possibilities and discover my true passion. It was this decision - along with a tip from a friend - that led me to LaunchCode.</p>

            <p class="funParagraph"> Currently, I find myself working at Amazon while simultaneously pursuing a degree in Computer Science, alongside my active involvement in Launchcode. Despite my busy schedule, I prioritize quality time with my family, sharing time with my wife, stepdaughter and close friends.Amidst the hustle and bustle, sometimes I can even find time for my hobbies. Hiking offers me a chance to connect with nature and unwind, while my passion for cooking allows me to experiment and create delicious dishes in my kitchen. Balancing work, academics, family, and personal interests can be demanding, but I try to embrace the challenges as much as possible.</p>

            <h2 id="subHeading">theFuture</h2>
            <p class="funParagraph">The future looks good. With my wife eight-and-a-half months pregnant, the arrival of our son is just around the corner. Alongside this new chapter in my personal life, I am equally excited about the professional prospects that lie ahead through LaunchCode. I feel like the skills I'm learning have the potential to open doors to challenges and oppurtunities, something I'm eagerly anticipating. While the future is shrouded with uncertainties, I'm really optimistic about what life has in store for me. I'm ready for it. </p>
